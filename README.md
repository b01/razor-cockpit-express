## How to Make a new ASP.NET App from Docker

The following command was used to generate the files in the `src` directory initially. It can be a good command when you want to 
make a new ASP.NET web project without installing .NET Core on your host machine and you already have Docker installed. Just be sure to change -v, -w, and --name flags to something suitable for your project.

```powershell
docker run -v "C:\Users\kshabazz\Projects\razor-cockpit-express\src:/app" -w "/app" --entrypoint=dotnet mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.2 new web
```
